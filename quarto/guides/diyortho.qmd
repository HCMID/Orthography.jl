`Orthography.jl` defines an abstract type `OrthographicSystem`

Concrete subtypes must implement three functions:

- `codepoints(orthography)`: returns a complete list of codepoints allowed in this orthography
- `tokentypes(orthography)`: returns a complete list of the types of tokens that can be recognized in this orthography.  These are subtypes of `TokenCategory`.
- `tokenize(s, orthography)`: use `orthography` to tokenize `s`.  This function is the basis for the higher-order functions presented in the following pages.
