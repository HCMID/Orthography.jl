This site introduces the conceptual model of orthography developed over several years in the work of the Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club (MID). 

It also includes documentation of `Orthography.jl`, a Julia package that implements the MID model of orthography. `Orthography.jl` supports working with editions of digital texts adhering to a specified orthography.
