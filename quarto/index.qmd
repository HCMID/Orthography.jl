title: "Orthography"
---

We can’t read a text until we understand its writing system; we can’t meaningfully work with a digital text until we understand how its writing system is encoded digitally.

`Orthography.jl` is a Julia package to address this problem.[^mid]


[^mid]: `Orthography.jl` was originally developed to support projects at the Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club (MID).
