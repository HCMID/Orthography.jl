title: "Validating orthography"

## `SimpleAscii`

The examples on this page use `SimpleAscii`, an orthography for a basic alphabetic subset of the ASCII character set. (In)

that is only meant to demonstrate the functionality of an orthographic system. 

`SimpleAscii` is a simple implementation of an orthographic system . 

:::{.callout-caution}
## Note on these examples
 Its definitions of lexical and punctuation tokens are reasonable, but the treatment of numeric tokens is naive and not suitable for real-world use.
:::

The `simpleAscii` function creates a `SimpleAscii` orthography for you. 

```{julia}
using Orthography
orthography = simpleAscii()
```

## The character set of an orthography

We can find all the codepoints that are allowed in an orthography with the `codepoints` function



```{julia}
codepointlist = codepoints(orthography)
```

Note that the results is a single String value, which in Julia can also be treated as a Vector of Chars.


The `validstring` function can use the orthographic system's information about what codepoints are valid.

```{julia}
validstring( "OK!", orthography)
```

```{julia}
newton = "Thë ōnly thîng bëttër than havîng a qualîty cîgar... îs havîng gōōd cōnvërsatîon tō accōmpany ît wîth"
validstring(newton, orthography)
```
